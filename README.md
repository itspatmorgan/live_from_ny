App Title: Live From New York
Creator: Patrick Morgan

Why this idea?
The New York Times has a page dedicated to seeing important historical events that happened 'on this day in history'. What they don't have, though, is a simple way to see the news articles written about those important days. 

What it does:
Using the New York Times Search API, I've built a simple app to allow users to search the NYTIMES archives for a specific date, view top articles from that day and save any interesting ones to a read-later profile.
